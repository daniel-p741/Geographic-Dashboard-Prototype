A prototype of Impact Allies' Geospatial Dashboard (Work-in-Progress). Only the dashboard code is to be made available as a demo; source datasets and pipeline assets will remain private unless specified otherwise. 

The Geospatial Dashboard is supported by a Dagster pipeline that performs filtering, classification, and analysis on institutional datasets. Each institution is displayed on an interactive OpenStreetMap-style map, accompanied by a t-SNE visualization that displays clustering/similarity based on institutional attributes.

Note: the Render instance may be slow to start up, as its still in development. The final version will be hosted on a dedicated server.
